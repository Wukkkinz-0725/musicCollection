# musicCollection



The music collection project is a web application that allows users to manage their music library by creating, reading, updating, and deleting songs using Python Flask as the web framework. The application uses HTML for the front-end interface, allowing users to interact with the API and manage their music collection.

MySQL is used as the database management system for the application, storing song information such as artist, album, genre, and release year. This allows for efficient querying and management of the music collection. AWS RDS is used as the cloud-based database service for hosting and scaling the MySQL database, ensuring high availability and scalability of the application.

The application supports various features such as searching, filtering, and sorting songs by different criteria. It also includes user authentication and authorization for performing certain actions, such as creating or deleting songs.
